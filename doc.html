 <h1>not24get - Collection of software and tips to make password quality enforcement easy</h1>
 <h2>About</h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Module to do password quality checks on LDAP directory level, not on user application level.</li>
    <li>Application to duplicate the quality checks for Samba as a work-around for a Samba bug</li> 
    <li>Recommended configuration for Samba, PAM and OpenLDAP</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Big picture and rationale</h2>
 <p>Most OpenLDAP deployments are used as back ends for Samba, as NT-style Windows Domains.
    While using LDAP directory as a back end for Samba is a very good idea, it also brings problems if our deployment
    needs to be compliant with EU Data Protection directive, or similar local laws.
    What this means, is that user set passwords need to have specific complexity.
    It's done to avoid simple and easy to guess passwords, like "password", "sally" and so on.
    Making Samba to enforce the complexity of the password is quite simple, one just need to use the <code>crackcheck</code>
    application included in Samba documentation (read <b>Alternative Samba password check setting</b> below to know how).
    The problem starts when other applications can authenticate with LDAP directory directly.
    If one can connect directly to LDAP directory, one can change his password to anything he wants, default OpenLDAP
    configuration won't enforce the password. We have exactly the same problem if there are regular UNIX servers in our
    domain that use LDAP directly &ndash; we should allow the users to change their passwords using the <code>passwd</code>
    command on any computer they can connect to and still have the complexity enforced.
    The only way to do it safely, is to delegate the password checking to the LDAP server itself, use 
    LDAP Password Modify Extended Operation (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3062">RFC3062)</a>) for password change
    and <code>slapo-ppolicy(5)</code> overlay together with <code>pwdCheckModule</code>.
    This way, no matter where the change originates from, the password will have to meet the same complexity requirements.
    Unfortunately, there's a bug in Samba, where if the password change in LDAP (or PAM for that matter) didn't succeed
    the Domain Controller returns "Permission denied" message.
    As can be imagined, this is quite confusing for users...
    This means, that the script Samba uses for quality checks needs to duplicate the checks the
    <code>pwdCheckModule</code> does in LDAP.

  <h2>Downloads</h2>
  <p>You can get the source code for those applications from
     <a href="https://github.com/tomato42/not24get">https://github.com/tomato42/not24get</a>

  <h2>Configuration</h2>
  <h3>Alternative Samba password check setting</h3>
  <p>
    With Samba you can also use the application included in documentation: <code>crackcheck</code>
    it should be in <code>examples/auth/crackcheck</code> folder in Samba documentation, available from
    <code>samba-doc</code>package.
    After compiling (or using the already compiled application if your distribution has one) you set the password options
    in <code>smb.conf</code> like that:
    <pre>
    check password script = /usr/bin/crackcheck -c -d /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict
    </pre>
  </p>
