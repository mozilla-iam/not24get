not24get is a module for password quality checking in OpenLDAP to be used
together with ppolicy.

It implements the API needed for use of library as a pwdCheckModule in ppolicy
It also provides an executable that can be used as "check password script" in
Samba suite.

This module will check for quality of password based on similar rationale as
there is behind the passwdqc PAM module or was shown in http://xkcd.com/936/

A password composed of few random common words is easy to remember and safer
than most passwords that get through the regular 3 out of 4 types of character
sets rule.
