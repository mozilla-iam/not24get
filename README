not24get is a module for password quality checking in OpenLDAP to be used
together with ppolicy.

It implements the API needed for use as a pwdCheckModule object in ppolicy.
It also provides an executable that can be used as "check password script" in
Samba suite (not24get_check).

This module will check quality of password based on similar rationale as
was shown in http://xkcd.com/936/, it's a wrapper around libpasswdqc, the
library that powers the pam_passwdqc module.

As password composed of few random common words is easy to remember and safer
than most passwords that get through the regular 3 out of 4 types of character
sets rule, the default configuration requires fairly long passwords.
